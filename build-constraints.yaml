# conflicts. This is intended for at least two use cases:
#
# * Making doctests pass (https://github.com/yesodweb/wai/issues/579)

# * Allowing tools like Stack to get a mapping from module name to package name
# for automatically installing dependencies

# This always use the cabal file shipped with the sdist tarball instead of the latest revision.
